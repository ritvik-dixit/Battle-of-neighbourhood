To complete the course 'Applied Data Science Capstone' 

> Final capstone project file name is __Capstone Project.ipynb__.

* Folium can not be rendered in github, so try this [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aditya-5842/Coursera-IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Capstone-Projects/blob/master/Capstone%20Project.ipynb) to see the plotted maps in notebook.
* Foursquare API has been used to get the nearby venues. To use Foursquare API you need to make developer account and ceate an app which will give the ClientID and Client Secret. Without this nearby venues can not be accessed. If someone don't want to make account then download the dataset from here: __New_York_venue.csv__ and __Toronto_venue.csv__. But I recommend to use the Forsquare API, because these data change over time.
